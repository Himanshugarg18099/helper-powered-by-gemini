# Gemini Windows Assistant - Product Manual

## 👷 Developer Flow (Building the Installer)

As the release architect, follow these steps to generate the `.msi` and `.exe`.

### 1. Initial Setup
Run these commands **once** to set up the build environment.

```powershell
# 1. Install Dependencies
npm install

# 2. Initialize Tauri (Only needed once)
# Accept all defaults, but set "Where are your web assets?" to "../dist"
npx tauri init
```

### 2. Configure Permissions
Edit `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` (generated by the init command) to allow Microphone access. Add this to the `tauri > allowlist` section if not present, or use the capability system in Tauri v2:

```json
// In src-tauri/capabilities/default.json (Tauri v2)
{
  "permissions": [
    "core:default",
    "shell:open",
    "dialog:open",
    "microphone:default" 
  ]
}
```

### 3. Build Production Installer
This compiles the React app and bundles it into a Windows installer.

```powershell
npm run tauri build
```

### 4. Locate Output
Your "Golden Master" files will be here:
*   **MSI Installer**: `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/msi/GeminiWin_1.0.0_x64_en-US.msi`
*   **Executable**: `src-tauri/target/release/GeminiWin.exe`
